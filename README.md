## Description
This repository explores the **U.S. Health Insurance dataset** through **data analytics and linear regression**.  
It includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`project_insurance_analysis.ipynb`)
- The raw dataset (`insurance.csv`)
- A PDF report and PowerPoint presentation
- A set of exported images and plots

---

## Motivation
Health insurance data reveals relationships between **age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and insurance costs**.  
This project demonstrates:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory analysis
- Regression modeling
- Communicating results via slides, reports, and visuals

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle â€“ US Health Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset/data)  
- **File**: `insurance.csv`  
- Contains demographic and lifestyle factors with insurance charges.  
- Key columns: `age`, `sex`, `bmi`, `children`, `smoker`, `region`, `charges`.

---

## Files in Repository
- `insurance.csv` â†’ dataset  
- `project_insurance_analysis.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter notebook with code & analysis  
- `Analysis of US Health Insurance data.pdf` â†’ written report  
- `Analysis of US Health Insurance data.pptx` â†’ presentation slides  
- `images/` â†’ exported plots and figures  
- `README.md` â†’ project description  

---

## Features
- Linear regression to predict insurance charges  
- Exploratory visualizations (BMI vs charges, smoker impact, region analysis)  
- Correlation and statistical insights  
- Reports and slides summarizing results  

---

## Installation
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BjoernMueller13/HealthInsuranceDataUS.git
cd HealthInsuranceDataUS
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

---

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook project_insurance_analysis.ipynb
```
- Run cells to reproduce analysis and plots  
- Review the PDF / PPTX for presentation of results  

---

## Reports & Presentations

## Visualizations & Images
The following images are included in the repository. Each one can be described in more detail:

*Distribution*
- Even distribution in age
- BMI: Gauss curve
- Charges: great left skew

*Outliers*
- 9 Outliers at BMI
- Over 100 Outliers at Charges

![Age, BMI, Charges Distributions](images/_AGE%20DISTRIBUTION_BMI%20DISTRIBUTION_CHARGES%20DISTRIBUTION.png) 

*Observation*
- Relatively even distribution between sex and region
- Uneven distribution between
  - Smokers
  - Children (w/ has a far higher concentration)

![Distribution of Sex, Regions, Smokers, Children](images/_DISTRIBUTION%20OF%20SEX_DISTRIBUTION%20OF%20REGIONS_DISTRIBUTION%20OF%20SMOKERS_DISTRIBUTION%20OF%20CHILDREN.png) 

*Observation*
- No great variation of smokers by region
- Small outlier: Southeast

![Smokers by Region](images/_SMOKERS%20AT%20NORTHEAST_SMOKERS%20AT%20NORTHWEST_SMOKERS%20AT%20SOUTHEAST_SMOKERS%20AT%20SOUTHWEST.png)  

*Observation*
- Relatively even distribution of smokers at a certain sex
- Males slightly higher than females

![Smokers by Males/Females](images/_SMOKERS%20AT%20MALES_SMOKERS%20AT%20FEMALES.png)  
![Distribution of Smokers by Sex](images/DISTRIBUTION%20OF%20SMOKERS%20BY%20SEX.png)  

*Observation*
Look on heatmap â†’ lowest horizontal line
- Greatest impact by age and BMI
- Low impact by number of children

![Correlation Heatmap](images/CORRELATION%20HEATMAP.png)  

Observation
ï‚¡ Impact by sex is evenly distributed by male and female
ï‚¡ Age is a higher impact
* IMAGE "RELATIONSHIP: CHARGES PER SEX" TO BE UPLOADED *
