## Description
This repository explores the **U.S. Health Insurance dataset** through **data analytics and linear regression**.  
It includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`project_insurance_analysis.ipynb`)
- The raw dataset (`insurance.csv`)
- A PDF report and PowerPoint presentation
- A set of exported images and plots

---

## Motivation
Health insurance data reveals relationships between **age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and insurance costs**.  
This project demonstrates:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory analysis
- Regression modeling
- Communicating results via slides, reports, and visuals

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle â€“ US Health Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset/data)  
- **File**: `insurance.csv`  
- Contains demographic and lifestyle factors with insurance charges.  
- Key columns: `age`, `sex`, `bmi`, `children`, `smoker`, `region`, `charges`.

---

## Files in Repository
- `insurance.csv` â†’ dataset  
- `project_insurance_analysis.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter notebook with code & analysis  
- `Analysis of US Health Insurance data.pdf` â†’ written report  
- `Analysis of US Health Insurance data.pptx` â†’ presentation slides  
- `images/` â†’ exported plots and figures  
- `README.md` â†’ project description  

---

## Features
- Linear regression to predict insurance charges  
- Exploratory visualizations (BMI vs charges, smoker impact, region analysis)  
- Correlation and statistical insights  
- Reports and slides summarizing results  

---

## Installation
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BjoernMueller13/HealthInsuranceDataUS.git
cd HealthInsuranceDataUS
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

---

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook project_insurance_analysis.ipynb
```
- Run cells to reproduce analysis and plots  
- Review the PDF / PPTX for presentation of results  

---

## Reports & Presentations

## Visualizations & Images
The following images are included in the repository. Each one can be described in more detail:

*Distribution*
- Even distribution in age
- BMI: Gauss curve
- Charges: great left skew

*Outliers*
- 9 Outliers at BMI
- Over 100 Outliers at Charges

![Age, BMI, Charges Boxplots](images/AGE_BOXPLOT_BMI_BOXPLOT_CHARGES_BOXPLOT.png)  
![Age, BMI, Charges Distributions](images/AGE_DISTRIBUTION_BMI_DISTRIBUTION_CHARGES_DISTRIBUTION.png)  

*Observation*
- Relatively even distribution between sex and region
- Uneven distribution between
  - Smokers
  - Children (w/ has a far higher concentration)

![Distribution of Sex, Regions, Smokers, Children](images/DISTRIBUTION_OF_SEX_DISTRIBUTION_OF_REGIONS_DISTRIBUTION_OF_SMOKERS_DISTRIBUTION_OF_CHILDREN.png)  
![Sex, Region, Smoker, Children Distributions](images/SEX_DISTRIBUTION_REGION_DISTRIBUTION_SMOKER_DISTRIBUTION_CHILDREN_DISTRIBUTION.png)  

*Observation*
- No great variation of smokers by region
- Small outlier: Southeast

![Smokers by Region](images/SMOKERS_AT_NORTHEAST_SMOKERS_AT_NORTHWEST_SMOKERS_AT_SOUTHEAST_SMOKERS_AT_SOUTHWEST.png)  

*Observation*
- Relatively even distribution of smokers at a certain sex
- Males slightly higher than females

![Smokers at Males / Females](images/SMOKERS_AT_MALES_SMOKERS_AT_FEMALES.png)  
![Distribution of Smokers by Sex](images/DISTRIBUTION_OF_SMOKERS_BY_SEX.png)   

*Observation*
Look on heatmap â†’ lowest horizontal line
- Greatest impact by age and BMI
- Low impact by number of children

![Correlation Heatmap](images/CORRELATION_HEATMAP.png)  
![Correlation Heatmap (Graphs)](images/CORRELATION_HEATMAP_GRAPHS.png)  

*Observation*
- Impact by sex is evenly distributed by male and female
- Age is a higher impact
  
![Relationship - Charges per Sex](images/RELATIONSHIP_-_CHARGES_PER_SEX.png)  

*Observation*
- Critical impact by smoking
- Age has an impact, too
  
![Relationship - Charges of Smokers & Non-Smokers](images/RELATIONSHIP_-_CHARGES_OF_SMOKERS_&_CHARGES_OF_NON-SMOKERS.png) 

*Observation*
- Number of children has almost no impact until a number of 3
- Great decrease at 4 and 5 children
- Great impact by smoking
  
![Charges by Number of Children](images/CHARGES_BY_NUMBER_OF_CHILDREN.png)  

*Clustering of BMI according to current standards:*
- BMI > 18.5 â†’ Underweight
- 18.5 < BMI < 25 â†’ Normal Weight
- 25 =< BMI < 30 â†’ Overweight
- 30 < BMI â†’ Obesity

*Observation*
- High percentage of obesity and overweight
- Keep in mind: BMI one of the highest impacts on charges

![Distribution of BMI Type](images/Distribution_of_BMI_Type.png)  

*Observation*
- No underweight people in southeast
- Highest charges for obesity
- Tie 2nd highest charges for normal and overweight
  - Assumption: affect by smokers

![Charges by BMI and Region](images/CHARGES_BY_BMI_AND_REGION.png)  

*Clustering*
- Clustering to risk level:
  - High risk: Obesity + Smoker
  - Moderate risk: normal/overweight + smoker
  - Else: low risk
    
- Clustering by age:
  - Age < 30 years
  - 30 years < Age < 50 years
  - Age > 50 years

![Distribution of Risk Type](images/DISTRIBUTION_OF_RISK_TYPE.png)  

*Observations*
- Charges increase with risk level
- Age as greater impact

![Charges by Age Type and Risk](images/CHARGES_BY_AGE_TYPE_AND_RISK.png)  

*KEY FINDINGS*
Findings (Data Distribution):

- Outliers:
  - BMI: 9
  - Charges: > 100 + Skew to the right

- More or less balanced distribution per
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Smokers
  - Region

Insights
- Smoking has a high impact on charges
- Also, obesity affects charges heavily
- Charges rise continuously per age
- Regional distribution of the factors including the sex mentioned above is relatively evenly done
- Low impact on charges by the number of children


*Linear Regression*
- Mean Squared Error: 0.285
- R-squared (RÂ²) on Test Set: 0.715
