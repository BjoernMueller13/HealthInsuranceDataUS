## Description
This repository explores the **U.S. Health Insurance dataset** through **data analytics and linear regression**.  
It includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`project_insurance_analysis.ipynb`)
- The raw dataset (`insurance.csv`)
- A PDF report and PowerPoint presentation
- A set of exported images and plots

---

## Motivation
Health insurance data reveals relationships between **age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and insurance costs**.  
This project demonstrates:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory analysis
- Regression modeling
- Communicating results via slides, reports, and visuals

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle ‚Äì US Health Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset/data)  
- **File**: `insurance.csv`  
- Contains demographic and lifestyle factors with insurance charges.  
- Key columns: `age`, `sex`, `bmi`, `children`, `smoker`, `region`, `charges`.
